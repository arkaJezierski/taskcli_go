# üõ†Ô∏è taskcli

**taskcli** is a command-line application for managing projects and tasks, written in Go using the cobra-cli tool
It supports full CRUD operations for projects and tasks which are assigned to any project.  
The app uses PostgreSQL or MySQL for persistence. I build this aplication using design patterns as much as i can.
